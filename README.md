WhatsTab:
--------------------
WhatsTab is a tool to help people easily install WhatsApp on their Google Nexus 7/other non-supported devices (e.g tablets) 
It works by extracting your WhatsApp installation from a mobile with adb-enabled recovery (CWM etc) to your tablet.

Previous WhatsApp installation methods were difficult for new users to follow or of varying success. The point of WhatsTab
is to make it easy for people to use WhatsApp on your device.
