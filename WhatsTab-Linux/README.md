WhatsTab - WhatsApp Installer for Tablets
-------------------------------------------
Since the release of the Nexus 7, many threads on XDA have been created offering options for getting WhatsApp to work. Some found sucess editing the apk permissions, some chose to restore from a TitaniumBackup backup. None of these worked for me, so instead, I wrote this.


This tool effectively transplants the data from your existing WhatsApp installation (on your mobile) onto your tablet. It extracts the phone and account data and transfers it onto the device. The program, when executed, will do the following:


**1.**	Wait for you to connect your **mobile**

**2.**	Reboot into recovery

**3.**	Extract account and phone data

**4.**	Wait for you to disconnect your mobile and connect your **tablet**

**5.**	Reboot into recovery

**6.**	Inject account and phone data

After, WhatsApp **should work on your tablet!** No TitaniumBackup, no AppGuard modifications.
